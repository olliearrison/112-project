# 112-project

I created ProCreate112, which is a drawing software based on ProCreate. With it, the user has the ability to sketch using the pencil, shade using the airbrush, and erase. Layers and color selection works the same way they might in a digital program. There is everything that one needs to create a simple illustration.
 
Run program from main.py

Libraries used: cmu-112-graphics, numpy, random, and colorsys

Directions to Use:
Press the plus button to create a new image from the gallery.
Press the wand icon to go back to the gallery.
Press the thumbnail image in the gallery to resume working on that image.
It will save while you are running so you can work on multiple drawings at once, but it does not back up locally. 

Use top slider to adjust brush size.
Use bottom slider to adjust opacity.
Press the button in between them and then click anywhere on the canvas to change your brush value.
Note: when you go back to the color selector, it will change the location of the white circle as well as 
the value to match the selected value.

Pressing the gear button will save a png with the white background to the "results" file.

Pressing the brush button will allow you to draw with a pencil.
Press the smudge brush button will allow you to draw with an airbrush.
Pressing the eraser button will change to an eraser (change the brush value to white).

Pressing "w" will zoom in the image.
Pressing "s" will zoom out the image.
The arrow keys will allow you to pan the image up and down and side to side.

Pressing "a" will increase lightness when the color selection window is open.
Pressing "d" will decrease lightness when the color selection window is open.
